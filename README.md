# Man

you can open [a manual of Ruby methods](http://ruby-doc.org/) so quickly


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'man'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install man

## Usage

if you want to know about Array#shuffle!, call `man` with an Array object and a method name.

```ruby
man Array.new, :shuffle!
```

Then open a reference page
